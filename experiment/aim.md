### Aim of the Experiment
To establish Bluetooth communication between a Raspberry Pi Pico and a smartphone, enabling remote control of an LED. The system should allow the LED to turn **ON** upon receiving a '1' signal and turn **OFF** upon receiving a '0' signal from the smartphone.

This experiment explores the integration of Bluetooth technology with embedded systems, demonstrating wireless communication and remote device management. It provides insights into microcontroller programming, serial communication, and real-world IoT applications.

#####  Applications
- **Home automation** systems for remotely controlling electrical appliances.  
  This allows users to manage devices like lights or fans from anywhere within range.  
- **IoT-based smart lighting** solutions.  
  Such systems can optimize energy usage by adjusting brightness based on user preferences.  
- **Wireless sensor networks** for industrial monitoring.  
  These networks enable real-time data collection from machinery to improve operational efficiency.  
- **Medical alert systems** for patient monitoring.  
  Bluetooth can transmit vital signs to healthcare providers for immediate response.  
- **Robotics and remote-controlled devices** using Bluetooth communication.  
  This enables precise control of robotic movements without the need for wired connections.
